# Evaluating-various-Clustering-Techniques-on-Mall-Customer-Data

The dataset used in this analysis is the Mall Customers data. We applied three different clustering techniques: K-Means, Agglomerative Clustering, and DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise). By employing these diverse methods, we aimed to comprehensively explore the clustering patterns and gain deeper insights into the customer segments. Each technique was chosen for its unique approach to clustering, providing a robust comparison of their performance and effectiveness on the dataset.
